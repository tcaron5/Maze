# Maze Solver

This project creates and solves a maze.

To run, make sure to include the 'javalib' library in your project.

## Features

1. **Random Maze Generation**: Create mazes with complexity and uniqueness using Kruskal's algorithm.

2. **Graphical Maze Display**: Visualize the maze for easy analysis and navigation.

3. **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Choose between Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search algorithms (or manually solve) to find the solution path from start to finish.

4. **New Maze Generation**: Generate new random mazes at your convenience for continued exploration.

5. **Solution Path**: Once found, the program displays the solution path connecting the start and end points.
